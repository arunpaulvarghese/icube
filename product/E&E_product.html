                      <p>We are Automatic water level controller manufacturers for the past 8 years. our electronic water level controller, which automatically controls all types of motor pumps to maintain the desired liquid level in the tank. If the overhead tank reaches the minimum level of water, the controller will switch on the pump and will switch off when the level reaches maximum. Similarly, the controller will sense the water level in the sump and switch off the pump when the sump water level reaches the minimum and switch on only if the sump level is increased to the maximum set level. <br><br> The controller will also sense the dry run and low voltage and switch off the motor immediately enabling the protection of the motor. We can also switch On the pump irrespective of the level in the overhead tank by pressing the manual switch.  Our product design and elite fashion will suit all modern modular kitchens.</p>

                      <h4>Automatic mains failure (AMF)</h4>
                      <p>Automatic main failure panels (AMF) are an inevitable control panel that must be used between the load and the power sources in a power distribution system. The main function of the unit is to make the power switch to emergency standby generators in the event of a significant loss of mains power or total blackout. The usage of AMF panels will help to protect data and avoid potential damage to electrical equipment, and huge amounts of disruption.  <br><br>Our research and development team created a unique technology for the AMF control board which ensures the life and precision of the system. Since the control boards are developed and manufactured under a global standard in our own production house we promise you that you will be satisfied with the quality and technology of our product.</p>
